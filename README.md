A toy font based on cscript, used for generating pretty looking art of
wizard-themed products.

It is not actually legible, for example `fuzz` and `cuzz` both read identically.
Maybe someday I'll spend the time to actually implement cscript properly, but I
don't have time to implement all those ligatures.
